# **Part 1: The Cognitive Revolution & Fundamental Debates**

## A - History: The Great Shift (1950s)

The Cognitive Revolution in the 1950s was a direct rebellion against "Behaviorism". Before the 1950s, Behaviorists treated the mind as an impenetrable "Black Box," focusing strictly on observable ==**stimulus**== and **==response==**. 

Everything changed at the 1956 MIT Symposium on Information Theory. Researchers introduced the "Computer Metaphor," realizing that human minds and machines both manipulate symbols and internal representations. [[Expanded Explanations/Lecture 1\|The fundamental shift was moving away from merely observing "what we do" to analyzing "how we process" information computationally.]]

## B - The Pioneers

1. **George Miller**: Proved there are strict limits to human mental processing capacity, famously encapsulated in his paper on the "Magical Number Seven".

2. **Noam Chomsky**: Completely rejected the Behaviorist idea that language is just a learned habit. Instead, he argued that language is an innate, computational system governed by strict, pre-existing rules.

3. **David Marr**: Created the definitive framework for analyzing cognitive systems via three distinct levels: Computational, Algorithmic, and Implementational.

4. **Herbert Simon and Allen Newell** were the first to build "Artificial Intelligence" programs capable of solving logic theorems. They made early, bold predictions about ==machines playing chess==. When programming game state classes or move generation rules in a modern chess engine, you are essentially building upon the symbolic logic foundation they championed. Interestingly, when they submitted their groundbreaking "Logic Theorist" program to an academic journal, it was rejected purely because ==the editors had no existing policy for publishing a paper authored by software==.

## C - Famous Debates 

- **Chomsky vs. Skinner:** Debated whether language is innate or learned through reinforcement, effectively ending Behaviorism's dominance.

- **Symbols vs. Neurons (Connectionism):** Debated whether the mind operates strictly like a logic machine (Symbolic AI) or as a statistical network (Neural Networks).

- **Nature vs. Nurture:** Questioned how much of our mental "hardware" is pre-programmed versus learned dynamically from environmental data. Today, modern cognitive science uses Bayesian Models to reconcile these views by combining structured innate knowledge with statistical learning.
